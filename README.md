e-counseling-frontend

"Counsel-Me" is a website dedicated to providing an easy-to-access counseling service for individuals who want to overcome their feelings of anxiety, # which may be interfering with their day-to-day functioning. The website offers immediate access to online counselors that individuals can speak with  # using a webcam service. At the end of a video chat session with a counselor, the individual can also create a plan with the counselor based on Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy to complete before their next visit with a counselor. For an individual dealing with social anxiety, it may be a task
such as "Hold three minimal conversations this week" for example, before moving on to larger tasks. With a free range of different counselors to speak # with, along with creating self-driven incentives to handle anxiety better through the direction of a counselor, Counsel-Me aims to make counseling easier to access.
